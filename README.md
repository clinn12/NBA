NBA Team Rewards

For teams in the NBA, there is no long term punishment for consistently losing or long term reward for consistently winning. 
This has led to teams to not fully compete on a nightly basis in the hopes of losing to gain a top draft pick at the end of the year, also known as "tanking". For those teams that have won consistently, they typically have lower positioned draft picks and are less likely to draft impactful players.

Without having some type of long term punishment or reward system in place, the NBA faces challenges to keep fans engaged with their favorite team. This presents many problems.
